The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?",

Therefore, triangle ABC is similar to triangle ADE, and we have AB/AD = BC/DE. Given that AB/AD = BC/DE = 1.6/1.4, we can solve for AB. Using cross-multiplication, we get AB = 1.6 * AD / 1.4. Since AD = AB - BD = AB - 0.55, we can substitute this into the equation to get AB = 1.6 * (AB - 0.55) / 1.4. Solving this equation, we find that AB = 4.4. Therefore, the answer is C.\nAnswer:C",

For a hexagon, \\(n = 6\\), so the sum of the interior angles is \\((6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\\).

The integrating factor is \\( e^{\\int -\\frac{3}{100} \\, dt} = e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} \\).\n\nMultiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor, we get:\n\\[ e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} \\frac{dQ}{dt} - \\frac{3}{100} e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} Q(t) = \\frac{3}{4} e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} \\]\n\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product \\( Q(t) e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( Q(t) e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} \\right) = \\frac{3}{4} e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to \\( t \\), we get:\n\\[ Q(t) e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} = \\int \\frac{3}{4} e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} \\, dt + C \\]\n\nThe integral on the right-hand side is:\n\\[ \\int \\frac{3}{4} e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} \\, dt = -\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{100}{3} e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} + C = -25 e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} + C \\]\n\nSo we have:\n\\[ Q(t) e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} = -25 e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} + C \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( e^{-\\frac{3}{100}t} \\), we get:\n\\[ Q(t) = -25 + C e^{\\frac{3}{100}t} \\]\n\nUsing the initial condition \\( Q(0) = Q_0 \\), we can find the constant \\( C \\):\n\\[ Q_0 = -25 + C e^0 \\]\n\\[ Q_0 = -25 + C \\]\n\\[ C = Q_0 + 25 \\]\n\nSo the solution is:\n\\[ Q(t) = -25 + (Q_0 + 25) e^{\\frac{3}{100}t} \\]\n\nTo find the limiting amount \\( Q_L \\) that is present after a very long time, we take the limit as \\( t \\) approaches infinity:\n\\[ Q_L = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} Q(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (-25 + (Q_0 + 25) e^{\\frac{3}{100}t}) \\]\n\nSince \\( e^{\\frac{3}{100}t} \\) approaches 0 as \\( t \\) approaches infinity, we have:\n\\[ Q_L = -25 + (Q_0 + 25) \\cdot 0 = -25 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( Q_0 = 2Q_L \\), we have:\n\\[ Q_0 = 2(-25) = -50 \\]\n\nNow we need to find the time \\( T \\) after which the salt level is within \\( 2\\% \\) of \\( Q_L \\). We set up the inequality:\n\\[ |Q(T) - Q_L| \\leq 0.02 |Q_L| \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( Q_L = -25 \\) and \\( Q_0 = -50 \\), we get:\n\\[ |-25 + (-50 + 25) e^{\\frac{3}{100}T} + 25| \\leq 0.02 |-25| \\]\n\\[ |-50 e^{\\frac{3}{100}T}| \\leq 0.02 \\cdot 25 \\]\n\\[ 50 e^{\\frac{3}{100}T} \\leq 0.5 \\]\n\\[ e^{\\frac{3}{100}T} \\leq \\frac{0.5}{50} \\]\n\\[ e^{\\frac{3}{100}T} \\leq 0.01 \\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{100}T \\leq \\ln(0.01) \\]\n\\[ T \\leq \\frac{100}{3} \\ln(0.01) \\]\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\\[ \\ln(0.01) \\approx -4.605 \\]\n\\[ T \\leq \\frac{100}{3} \\cdot (-4.605) \\]\n\\[ T \\leq -153.5 \\]\n\nSince time cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\\[ T \\approx 153.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the time \\( T \\) after which the salt level is within \\( 2\\% \\) of \\( Q_L \\) is approximately \\( 153.5 \\) minutes.",

For \\( 2x - 3 \\geq 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( x \\geq \\frac{3}{2} \\), the function becomes \\( f(x) = (2x - 3) + 1 = 2x - 2 \\). The derivative of this part is \\( f'(x) = 2 \\).\n\n2.

The derivative of this part is \\( f'(x) = -2 \\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the derivative at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\):\n\n- At \\( x = 0 \\), since \\( 0 < \\frac{3}{2} \\), we use the second case: \\( f'(x) = -2 \\).\n- At \\( x = 5 \\), since \\( 5 > \\frac{3}{2} \\), we use the first case: \\( f'(x) = 2 \\).\n\nComparing the derivatives:\n- The derivative at \\( x = 0 \\) is \\( -2 \\).\n- The derivative at \\( x = 5 \\) is \\( 2 \\).\n\nSince \\( -2 \\) is smaller than \\( 2 \\), the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) at \\( x = 0 \\) is smaller than that at \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n(C) smaller than",

Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ (120 - k) + 120 = 180 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\\[ 240 - k = 180 \\]\n\\[ k = 60 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\(x\\), which is the angle at \\(B\\). The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ x + (120 - k) + 120 = 180 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(k = 60\\):\n\\[ x + (120 - 60) + 120 = 180 \\]\n\\[ x + 60 + 120 = 180 \\]\n\\[ x + 180 = 180 \\]\n\\[ x = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the steps:\n\nGiven that \\(k = 60\\), we should have used \\(k\\) directly in the equation for \\(x\\) without solving for \\(k\\) first. The correct approach is to express \\(x\\) directly in terms of \\(k\\).\n\nThe sum of angles in triangle \\(ABC\\) is 180 degrees:\n\\[ x + (120 - k) + 120 = 180 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[ x + 240 - k = 180 \\]\n\\[ x = 180 - 240 + k \\]\n\\[ x = k - 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(k\\) is \\(x = k - 60\\).\n\nThe correct answer is not listed among the options provided.

            "response": "Solution: Since the ship sails due east from point A at a speed of 40 nautical miles per hour and arrives at point B at 9:30, which is half an hour later, we can conclude that AB = 40×0.5 = 20 nautical miles. Let's assume that the point of intersection of the perpendiculars from point M to the straight lines AB and AC is point O. From the given information, we know that angle MAO = 45° and angle MBO = 15°. Therefore, we can deduce that angle MBA = 30°. Thus, we have OB = 1/2 AB = 10 nautical miles. Furthermore, we can calculate BM = 2OB = 20 nautical miles. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\nAnswer:D",

Since the rectangle is subdivided into two identical squares, the length of the rectangle is twice the side length of one square, which is 2 * 3 = 6. The width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of one square, which is 3. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

            "response": "To determine which of the given options cannot be the perimeter of the triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. According to this theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nGiven two sides of the triangle are 12 and 7, let's denote the third side as \\( x \\). The triangle inequality theorem gives us the following inequalities:\n\n1. \\( 12 + 7 > x \\)\n2. \\( 12 + x > 7 \\)\n3. \\( 7 + x > 12 \\)\n\nFrom the first inequality:\n\\[ 19 > x \\]\n\\[ x < 19 \\]\n\nFrom the second inequality:\n\\[ 12 + x > 7 \\]\n\\[ x > -5 \\]\n\nFrom the third inequality:\n\\[ 7 + x > 12 \\]\n\\[ x > 5 \\]\n\nCombining these inequalities, we get:\n\\[ 5 < x < 19 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the possible perimeters:\n- The minimum perimeter occurs when \\( x \\) is just above 5:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 12 + 7 + 5.01 = 24.01 \\]\n\n- The maximum perimeter occurs when \\( x \\) is just below 19:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 12 + 7 + 18.99 = 37.99 \\]\n\nTherefore, the perimeter must be between 24.01 and 37.99. Among the given options, 38 is outside this range.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n(D) 38",

In the given figure, the curve is concave up, and the acceleration vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is pointing in a direction that suggests it has both tangential and normal components.\n\nGiven that the magnitude of the acceleration vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is \\(10 \\, \\text{cm/s}^2\\), and assuming the figure is drawn to scale, we can estimate the normal component by considering the angle \\(\\theta\\) that the vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) makes with the tangent to the curve at that point. However, without specific angle measurements or additional information, we can only make a rough estimate based on the visual representation.\n\nFrom the figure, it appears that the vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is pointing at an angle that is not too far from being perpendicular to the tangent of the curve. If we assume that the angle \\(\\theta\\) is approximately \\(45^\\circ\\), then the normal component of the acceleration can be estimated using the formula for the normal component of acceleration, which is \\(a_n = a \\sin(\\theta)\\).\n\nFor \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\), \\(\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), so:\n\n\\[a_n = 10 \\, \\text{cm/s}^2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 7.07 \\, \\text{cm/s}^2\\]\n\nTherefore, the estimated normal component of the acceleration vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is approximately \\(7.07 \\, \\text{cm/s}^2\\).\n\nHowever, since the question asks for an integer answer, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is \\(7 \\, \\text{cm/s}^2\\).\n\nFinal value: 7",

However, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side (triangle inequality theorem).\n\nGiven the sides \\(6x + 2\\) and \\(9x - 2\\), we can set up the inequality:\n\n\\[6x + 2 + 9x - 2 > 8 + 10\\]\n\nSimplifying the inequality:\n\n\\[15x > 18\\]\n\n\\[x > \\frac{18}{15}\\]\n\n\\[x > \\frac{6}{5}\\]\n\n\\[x > 1.2\\]\n\nGiven the options, the only value of \\(x\\) that satisfies \\(x > 1.2\\) is \\(x = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 4.",
